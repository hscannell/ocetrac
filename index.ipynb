The goo is constantly changing shape and size, sometimes merging or splitting into two! It's a lot to keep track of. Some geophysical properties can act like to goo in the lava lamp. Using `Ocetrac` we can more easily characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of these features to characterize their behaviors over time. \n",
